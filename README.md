# METIS-NLP
NLP Project

## Summary
The goal of this project was to use topic modeling to organize viewers comments on Buttery Bros youtube videos. This
would allow the organization to better understand what content their viewers will interact with, which could shape future
content to make it more appealing to viewers. The data was pulled from their last 100 videos using the youtube API. The
data required extensive preprocessing before Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
topic models could be used
